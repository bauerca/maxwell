Distributed-memory parallel eigensolver for Maxwell's equations.

See the following publications for an idea of what this software can do.

- [A fast multigrid-based electromagnetic eigensolver for curved metal boundaries on the Yee mesh](http://carlbauer.org/static/pdf/dey-mittra-multigrid-solver.pdf)
- [A second-order 3D electromagnetics algorithm for curved interfaces between anisotropic dielectrics on a Yee mesh](http://carlbauer.org/static/pdf/second-order-yee-dielectrics.pdf)
